/**
 * Identifies an [Entity]. Entities represent a thread of continuity and identity, going through a lifecycle,
 * though their attributes may change. Means of identification may come from the outside, or it may be an arbitrary
 * identifier created by and for the system, but it must correspond to the identity distinctions in the model. The model
 * must define what it means to be the same thing.
 *
 * Kotlin's counterpart of Java's [Entity](https://github.com/xmolecules/jmolecules/blob/main/jmolecules-ddd/src/main/java/org/jmolecules/ddd/types/Entity.java)
