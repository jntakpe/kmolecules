 * natural responsibility of an entity or value object, add an operation to the model as a standalone interface declared
 * as a service. Define a service contract, a set of assertions about interactions with the service. (See assertions.)
 * State these assertions in the ubiquitous language of a specific bounded context. Give the service a name, which also
 * becomes part of the ubiquitous language.
